# Hi, I'm Quintin :wave:

I am learning a lot, maybe to much. Software development, web applications, game development, analog game design, pixel art, 3D modeling, drawing and painting.
My main focus is building [Quest for Game Dev][q4gd] :video_game:, where I create guides on how to develop different games types .
