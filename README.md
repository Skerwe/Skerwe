# Hi, I'm Quintin :wave:

I like to give back to the development community by creating free and open source content.

In the past year I have been learning a lot. Software development, web application development, game development, analog game design, pixel art, 3D modeling, drawing and painting.

My main focus is building :video_game: [Quest for Game Dev][q4gd], where I create guides on developing different game types.
